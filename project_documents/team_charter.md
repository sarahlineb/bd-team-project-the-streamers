# [The Streamers] Team Charter

## Purpose

As we learned from the reading, highly performing teams have the following
qualities:

* Psychological safety
* Dependability
* Structure and clarity
* Meaning
* Impact

Your team’s charter captures the ways in which your team will commit to
providing and cultivating these qualities. Provide the information requested in
this charter, but feel free to modify the formatting to best suit your team’s
needs and style.

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
    *E.g., Be open to opinions that differ from your own, actively ask for
    opinions from each member of the team, do not interrupt each other, don’t
    place blame, all suggestions or questions are encouraged, listened to,
    considered equally, and never judged*

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
    *E.g., communicate when there is a misunderstanding, don’t move forward
    until the situation is resolved, directly address and resolve negativity,
    give and receive feedback with a positive, strength-building mindset, if
    necessary, escalate to a BloomTech staff member*  

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
     *E.g., estimate task size, break down large tasks, call out tasks at risk
     early, ask each other for help, how to ensure timely code reviews, how to
     share knowledge, help each other hold accountability give frequent,
     scheduled updates*  

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
     *E.g., acknowledge, but don’t punish slipped dates, figure out what went
     wrong, identify lessons for future*

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
     *E.g., where to track goals and when to review them, use definitive,
     quantifiable terminology, include clear background on why this goal is
     necessary, include “done” criteria for the goal (code is pushed with
     integration tests, document is reviewed, etc.)*


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
    *E.g., “Apply what we’ve learned throughout BloomTech in a team project to prepare
    ourselves for internships and full-time SDE roles.”*


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
    *What will be true when you have 'succeeded' on this project? E.g. enjoy
    ourselves, maintain our energy to the end, ensure all team members
    participate, create professional connections, exceed instructor
    expectations, efficiently pace the project so we’re not rushing at the end,
    etc.*


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
    *E.g., develop SDE knowledge, enhance leadership skills, master project
    planning, improve testing skills, etc*


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals,
  complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
    *E.g., leadership, meeting procedures/length of meetings, expectations for
    meeting attendance and timeliness, other types of meetings (happy hours,
    lunch and learns)*


## Meaning & Impact

**What is personally important for each team member about joining BloomTech? About
becoming an software engineer?**

* ***Sarah***: I've always enjoyed the technical industry and I really just want to get a 
nice career in tech and network. I feel like Bloomtech is a great stepping stone into a software career.

* ***Deepali***: I've regretted not completing my degree in Computer Science and Bloomtech 
is a great way for me to get back into programming and software. I've always wanted to become a software 
engineer and Bloomtech is a great place to start without having the 4 years commitment. 

**What each team member wants to achieve: e.g. improve analytical skills, learn
project management skills, develop public speaking skills, speak up more, speak
up less, etc.**

* ***Sarah***: I want to improve my analytical and critical thinking skills, my teamwork skills, and real
world applications.

* ***Deepali***: I would also like to improve my analytical and critical thinking skills, as well as 
developing public speaking and leadership skills.
