# The Streamers Design Document

## Instructions

## *Underground* Design

## 1. Problem Statement

Streamers is a streaming service that provides expertly curated content for listeners
who want suggestions of underground artists that fit their specific tastes.

This design document describes the Streamers service, a new service that will
provide a custom playlist based on our customers' needs. Users will be equipped with the
ability to listen to new, upcoming, underground artists based on their current interests and
preferences. Their playlist will be updated by their personal preferences based
off the song tables that we have curated. The user will also have access to additional songs that are
similar to their preferences.

User takes survey, brand new playlist is created with 10 songs,
user will upvote or downvote with their survey playlist, 
upvote will be added to the users playlist and downvote will not be added,
backend creates USER playlist based off the survey playlist, 
backend will return a playlist just for the user based on upvotes & GENRE

user will have access to other songs based on the GENRE (colors) keep a tally of these to provide the rest of the songs

## 2. Top Questions to Resolve in Review

*List the most important questions you have about your design, or things that
you are still debating internally that you might like help working through.*

1. What defines a lesser known artist?
2. How will we organize all of the data? If the user dislikes a certain song, do they have to
   continue through the whole playlist or
3. How many songs based off the user survey will be provided? We can have one song provided, 
   or a list of 10 songs?
4. Are the upvotes going to be their playlist songs?
5. How can we populate tables in DynamoDB using the YAML files.

## 3. Use Cases

*This is where we work backwards from the customer and define what our customers
would like to do (and why). You may also include use cases for yourselves, or
for the organization providing the product to customers.*

U1. *As an Underground customer, I want to have the option to save the music that I like when I am suggested songs.*

U2. *As an Underground customer, I want to be able to skip over songs that I don't care for*

U3. *As an Underground customer, I want to be able to browse the libraries according to genre*

U4. *As an Underground customer, I want to listen to music that is curated to my own tastes*

U4. *As an Underground customer, I want the option to listen to diverse new artists*


We are using DynamoDB to save time because storage is cheap and time is not.

## 4. Project Scope

### 4.1. In Scope

* Creating a playlist based on song recommendations from the users genre preferences
* Saving songs from different genre playlists on to your own customized playlist
* User can browse through entire library
* Upvoting and downvoting song choices
* User will have a customized playlist saved under their unique UserID


### 4.2. Out of Scope

* Song capacity is limited to 100 to start
* Genres are limited to 12 to start
* Integration with Spotify
* The ability for each user to create more than one playlist
* Songs only have one tag instead of multiple
* The ability to search for songs, genres must be browsed to find songs
* Sharing playlists between users

# 5. Proposed Architecture Overview

*This basic iteration will provide the user with the ability to be exposed to new and upcoming artists. The user will have the ability to
search through music organized by genre, add songs to a custom playlist and also will be provided a playlist based on their preferences
which will be compiled by the initial mainstream music survey.*

*We will store the songs available in sepearate tables using DynamoDB. Playlists and user lists will also be stored in DynamoDB.*

*We will use API Gateway and Lambda to create endpoints that will handle the creation and retrieval of the 2 playlists per user.*

*The user will go through a web interface to manage their playlists and to view the provided music library.*

# 6. API

## 6.1. Public Models

```
// PlaylistModel

String id;
String name;
String customerId;
Integer songCount;
List<String> tags;
```

```
// UserModel

String id;
String name;
String customPlaylistId;
String providedPlaylistId;
```

## 6.2. *Get Provided Playlist Endpoint*

*Accepts GET requests*
*Accepts data from initial survey to create a new playlist based on user preference. Playlist is assigned to specific
user ID.
*The user ID will have genre tags assigned based on initial preference.

## 6.3. *Create User Playlist Endpoint*

*Accepts POST requests*
*Accepts data to create a new playlist with provided user ID.
*Playlist ID must be alphanumeric.
   *If the ID contains any invalid characters, an 'InvalidCharacterException' will be thrown.

## 6.4 *Update User Playlist Endpoint*

*Accepts PUT requests*
*Accepts data provided by user to create a new custom playlist, including a new playlist ID. User can add or remove songs
from playlist. 
*User has the ability to change the order of the songs (Shuffle, Reverse or Default).
*If the user does not enter the correct User ID - an 'InvalidUserIdException' will be thrown.
